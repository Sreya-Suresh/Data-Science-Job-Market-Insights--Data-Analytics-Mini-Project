# Data-Science-Job-Market-Insights--Data-Analytics-Mini-Project
Data Science Job Market Insights is a data analytics mini project that utilizes Excel for data preprocessing and Power BI for interactive visualizations to analyze data science job trends.
1. Project Overview
  •	This mini project focuses on analysing the Data Science job market to identify trends related to job availability, salary distribution, company characteristics, and industry demand. The project aims to
transform raw job listing data into meaningful insights using data preprocessing and interactive visualization techniques.
  •	Microsoft Excel was used for data cleaning and preparation, while Power BI was used to build an interactive dashboard that helps users explore patterns and insights in the data science job landscape.
3. Tool Used
  •	Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing
  •	Power BI – Data modelling, DAX measures, and interactive visualization
4. Dataset
  •	Source: Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv 
  •	Data contains: Index, Job Title, Minimum Salary, Maximum Salary, Average Salary, Company Name, Rating, Location, Headquarters, Employee Size, Founded, Type of Ownership, Industry, Sector, Revenue, Competitors.
5. Steps Followed

    o	Removed blank, duplicate, and inconsistent records
    o	Standardized job titles and company-related fields
  •	Performed basic validation and structuring in Excel
  •	Imported the cleaned data into Power BI
  •	Created DAX measures such as:
    o	Total Data Science Jobs
    o	Average Salary
    o	Company Count
    o	Highly Rated Companies
  •	Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard using:
    o	Cards (KPIs)
    o	Bar and Column Charts
    o	Pie Chart
    o	Scatter Plot
    o	Map Visualization
